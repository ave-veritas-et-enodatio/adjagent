"""Mechanical integrity check for the knowledge-base claim-quality framework.

Read-only. Never modifies any file. Reads the unified ``kb-frontmatter`` block
(format contract: ``METADATA_SCHEMA.md``, beside this module).

Fourteen checks, all hard fail-loud:

    0. Quality-block integrity: every ``### Quality`` heading in a
       ``claim-quality.md`` register sits within a ``---``-delimited section
       that also carries the claim's ``## <title>`` heading and its
       ``<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`` marker. An orphan ``### Quality`` block is
       a hard failure. (Not refresh-fixable; delete the orphan or restore the
       missing title/id.)
    1. Tier 1 coverage: every leaf declares its content via at least one of
       ``{claims:, no-claim:, exp-id:}`` (hosting an experiment node satisfies
       coverage on its own). ``claims`` and ``no-claim`` stay mutually exclusive
       with each other; ``exp-id`` is orthogonal and may co-exist with either.
    2. Tier 2 coverage: every multi-claim leaf has proximal inline markers
       (``<!-- claim-quality: <id> ... -->``) for each ID in its claims list.
    3. ID uniqueness: no canonical ``<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`` appears twice
       in any ``claim-quality.md`` register.
    4. Orphan refs: every Tier 1 ID resolves to a canonical entry.
    5. Frontmatter presence: every non-excluded .md file has a frontmatter
       block (refresh-fixable for indexes; manual fix for leaves).
    6. Subtree consistency: each ``kind: index`` file's ``subtree-claims``
       equals the union of leaf claims under its directory; entry-point's
       equals the global union. (refresh-fixable.)
    7. Bidirectional coverage: every canonical entry is back-linked by at
       least one leaf's frontmatter.
    8. No-claim/claims exclusivity: no leaf carries both fields.
    9. Index files well-formed: each ``.index/*.jsonl`` exists, every line
       parses as a JSON object, and the file ends with exactly one ``\\n``.
       Missing files and EOF defects are refresh-fixable; malformed JSON is
       not (indicates a bug or merge corruption).
   10. Index freshness: each ``.index/*.jsonl`` matches the canonical
       byte-for-byte serialization of the in-memory record set built from
       the canonical KB sources. (refresh-fixable.)
   11. Index referential integrity: every id referenced in depends-on /
       strengthen-by / cites / subtree-aggregates resolves to a record in
       claims.jsonl (which holds claim + framework nodes), and every
       depends-on edge's target_kind matches the resolved node's node_type.
       (Not refresh-fixable; symptom of a build bug.)
   12. Solidity-graph acyclicity: the claim depends-on graph must be a DAG.
       A cycle makes solidity undefined for its members. (Not refresh-fixable;
       the cycle must be broken in the claim depends-on declarations.)
   13. Solidity freshness: every claim entry's on-disk ``solidity`` line and
       the depends-on ``(solidity X)`` annotations must equal what
       ``kb_index_lib.compute_solidity`` derives, and the ``.index/claims.jsonl``
       solidity fields must match. ``solidity`` is a derived field — drift
       means refresh has not been run. (refresh-fixable.)
   14. Leaf-references freshness: every claim-quality entry's on-disk
       ``> **Leaf references:**`` footer must equal what
       ``kb_index_lib.build_leaf_references`` derives from the reverse-citation
       map (which leaves host the entry's id). The footer is a derived field;
       a hand-edited, stale, or missing footer is drift. (refresh-fixable.)

Future / queued (not implemented):

* A relative-link integrity check — verify that each Markdown
  cross-reference in a leaf resolves to an existing file, and surface dead
  *forward* links (a foundational common/ or vol1 leaf pointing to a
  not-yet-migrated later-volume leaf) as an optional warning rather than a
  hard failure. Such forward links are intentional threads for later
  cross-reference stitching passes; only their dead-ness is worth flagging,
  not their existence.

Failure categories are tagged refresh-fixable or manual-fix. If any
refresh-fixable failures are present, the report ends with a hint to run
the project's refresh target first; verify is read-only and never auto-fixes.

Run via the project's verify target, or directly::

    """Verify each entry's on-disk leaf-references footer matches the derived one.

    The ``> **Leaf references:**`` footer is a derived field (INVARIANT-S8):
    regenerated by the refresh target from the reverse-citation map
    (which leaves host the entry's id) and gated here. The reverse map comes
    from the SAME ``kb_index_lib.build_leaf_references`` the refresher writes
    from, so this checker and the emitter cannot drift.

    For every ``clm-`` / ``sup-`` entry in every register, locates the footer
    line in the band between the entry's ``<!-- id: ... -->`` marker and its
    ``### Quality`` heading and compares it byte-for-byte to the regenerated
    footer. Three drift kinds (all refresh-fixable):

    * a present footer whose text disagrees with the regenerated one (the rot
      this gate eliminates — a hand-edited or stale footer);
    * a MISSING footer where the entry should carry one;
    * an entry whose id has no citing leaf at all (the footer regenerates to the
      explicit ``*(none …)*`` marker; bidirectional-coverage flags the deeper
      defect, but the footer drift is still reported).

    Returns ``(register_path, node_id, got, want)`` tuples. ``got`` is the
    on-disk footer (or ``"(missing)"``); ``want`` is the regenerated footer.
    Code fences are scrubbed so a fenced example footer is never parsed.
