# KB Derived Index — Metadata Schema Specification (generic)

**Corpus-neutral format contract.** This document specifies the derived-index
format the `kb_tools` toolchain builds, validates, and queries: the canonical
JSONL files under a KB's `.index/` directory, the record shapes within each, the
build invariants, and the query semantics the runtime module (`kb_cmd/index.py`)
provides over them. It is independent of any particular corpus — a KB built with
this toolchain conforms to this contract regardless of subject matter.

> **Per-project scope vs. this contract.** This spec defines the *full*
> capability of the format — every node type, edge class, and solidity branch.
> Any given KB may exercise only a subset (see [Project scoping](#project-scoping)).
> A project that populates only claim nodes still conforms; the unused
> record schemas simply have zero instances. A project may keep a *local*
> `SCHEMA.md` alongside its `.index/` that pins its own scope, examples, and node
> population; this document is the format contract that local copy specializes.

Throughout, `<kb-root>/` denotes the KB's top-level directory (the toolchain
single-sources its name in `kb_util.KB_DIRNAME`). Paths in records are
POSIX-style, relative to `<kb-root>/`.

This `.index/` directory is **derived** from canonical sources:

- Leaf frontmatter (`claims:`, `experiments:`, `subtree-claims:`,
  `subtree-experiments:`, `kind:`, `path-stable`, `no-claim`) in every KB `.md`
  file outside `session/`.
- Experiment-hosting frontmatter (`exp-id:`, `status:`, `strengthens:`) in every
  leaf that hosts an experiment node — experiment-ness is conferred by HOSTING an
  `exp-id`, not by a `kind` (the container `kind` stays `leaf` / `leaf-as-index`).
  A container may host SEVERAL `exp-id:` (each opening its own `status:` /
  `strengthens:` block) and may co-host `claims:` and `sup-id:` (orthogonal
  node-bodies) (INVARIANT-S9).
- Support-hosting frontmatter (`sup-id:` + `supports:`) in every leaf that hosts a
  support node — support-ness is conferred by HOSTING a `sup-id`. A container may
  host SEVERAL `sup-id:` (each opening its own `supports:` block) and may co-host
  `claims:` / `exp-id:` / `no-claim:` (INVARIANT-S10).
- Tier 2 inline markers (`<!-- claim-quality: <id> ... -->`) in multi-claim leaves.
- Claim-quality entries in every `claim-quality.md` register (root, per-volume,
  common).

Every file under `.index/` is regeneratable from those canonical sources via
the project's refresh target. If any file here disagrees with what regeneration
would produce, the canonical sources win and the file is rebuilt. The freshness
verifier (the verify target) runs the build in dry-run and diffs against on-disk; a non-empty
diff = stale index = hard failure.

**Two-graph model.** A KB `.md` leaf is a **container**, and two orthogonal graphs
run through it. (1) The **topography graph** — the hyperlink/navigation tree — in
which a container's `kind` (`leaf` | `leaf-as-index` | `index` | `entry-point`) is
its structural-position label; `kind` does NOT encode node-flavor. (2) The **claim
graph** — an acyclic graph of `clm` (claim), `exp` (experiment), and `sup`
(support) node-bodies a leaf *originates*, connected by `strengthens` (exp→clm),
`supports` (sup→clm), and `references` (leaf→exp) edges. **A container hosts ANY
number of ANY combination of `clm` / `exp` / `sup` node-bodies** — there is no
one-per-leaf and no one-per-flavor cap (one file may originate a `claims:` list,
several `exp-id:`, and several `sup-id:`). These are declared additively in
frontmatter and are independent of the container's `kind`. The reverse views
materialized here (`strengthen-by`, `supported-by`, `cites`) are untraversed
bookkeeping — convenience indexes, not part of the forward acyclic graph.

## Project scoping

Which node types a KB populates is a project decision, not a property of the
format:

- **Claim nodes** (`clm-`) are the universal core; every KB has them.
- **Framework nodes** (`invariant` / `axiom`) are populated only if the KB's
  `<kb-root>/CLAUDE.md` declares invariant/axiom headings (see
  [Framework-node provenance](#record-schemas)). A KB with none simply has zero
  framework nodes; claim chains then terminate on dependency-free foundational
  claims, and out-of-graph modeling assumptions are noted in claim rationales as
  prose rather than as nodes.
- **Experiment nodes** (`exp-`) are populated only by a KB that documents *physical
  experiments the authors design, originate, and control*. A KB that designs no
  such experiments has zero experiment nodes (a simulation feeds derivation
  confidence, not experimental solidity; a re-analysis of outside/public data is a
  `sup-` support node or a `clm-` citation, never an `exp-` — see INVARIANT-S9).
- **Support nodes** (`sup-`) are populated only by a KB that carries non-physical
  analytical support (an outside analysis lifting a claim's local rigor without
  gating it).

The `exp-` / `sup-` / framework record schemas, edge classes, and solidity
branches below are specified for completeness and are always available; a KB that
does not exercise them simply materializes none of those records. Verify and
refresh stay green either way.

## File inventory

| File | Records | Sort key | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claims.jsonl` | one per graph node (claim / invariant / axiom / experiment / support) | `(node_type, id)` | Canonical graph nodes — claims, framework nodes, experiments, support nodes |
| `depends-on.jsonl` | one per forward dependency edge (`depends` / `strengthens` / `supports`) | `(source, target, context)` | "What does X depend on / strengthen / support?" |
| `strengthen-by.jsonl` | one per open work item | `(claim_id, item_idx)` | "What gates this claim?" / "Where is this strengthen-by item being worked on?" |
| `supported-by.jsonl` | one per (claim, supporting support) edge | `(claim_id, sup_id)` | "Which support nodes lift claim X, and by how much?" (reverse view of `supports` edges; untraversed bookkeeping) |
| `cites.jsonl` | one per (claim, leaf) citation edge | `(claim_id, leaf_path)` | "Which leaves cite claim X?" (inverse of leaf frontmatter) |
| `subtree-aggregates.jsonl` | one per index / entry-point node | `node_path` | Precomputed subtree-claims aggregation |

All files are JSONL — one JSON object per line, no trailing whitespace, single
trailing newline at EOF. Keys appear in fixed order per record type (specified
below) so byte-identical regeneration is guaranteed.

---

## Build invariants

These hold across every regeneration. They are checked by the freshness verifier
(the project's verify target):

1. **Determinism.** Running refresh against the same canonical state yields
   byte-identical files. No timestamps, no random IDs, no environment-dependent
   paths embedded in records.
2. **Sort stability.** Each file's records are sorted by the file's sort key. A new
   claim or edge appears as one inserted line in `git diff`, never reorders
   surrounding lines.
3. **Schema closure.** Every record matches the schema in this document. Unknown
   fields are a hard verifier failure (catches drift between schema and emitter).
4. **Referential integrity.** Every ID referenced in `depends-on.jsonl`,
   `strengthen-by.jsonl`, `cites.jsonl`, or `subtree-aggregates.jsonl` resolves to
   a record in `claims.jsonl` — which holds claim, framework, **and experiment**
   nodes. For a `relation:"depends"` edge: `source` resolves to a claim, `target`
   may resolve to any node type, and `target_kind` must equal the resolved target's
   `node_type` (kind-match). For a `relation:"strengthens"` edge: `source` resolves
   to an **experiment** node, `target` resolves to a **claim** (and
   `target_kind == "claim"`); experiment nodes are never edge `target`s and never
   appear in `cites`. For a `relation:"supports"` edge (INVARIANT-S10): `source`
   resolves to a **support** node, `target` resolves to a **claim** (and
   `target_kind == "claim"`), `strength` is null, and `fraction` is in (0,1] OR the
   literal `"*pending*"` (distinct on disk from a depends edge's null fraction).
   The `\bsup-[a-z0-9]{6}\b` id format is enforced for support nodes;
   `supported-by` `claim_id`/`sup_id` must resolve to a claim/support node
   respectively. `strengthen-by` / `cites` `claim_id` and `subtree-aggregates`
   `subtree_claims` reference **claim** ids only; `subtree-aggregates`
   `subtree_experiments` references **experiment** ids only (a claim id there is a
   kind mismatch). The `\bexp-[a-z0-9]{6}\b` id format is enforced for experiment
   nodes. (Orphan, kind-mismatch, or relation/source-type mismatch is a verifier
   failure.)
   - **Leaf `experiments:` references.** A leaf may carry an optional
     `experiments: [exp-xxxxxx, ...]` frontmatter field — the experiment-reference
     analog of `claims:` (a leaf-level citation, the inverse of an experiment's
     Leaf-references; NOT rolled up transitively, NOT for mere prose mentions).
     Every id in any leaf's `experiments:` must be a well-formed exp-id AND resolve
     to an actual experiment node (an `exp-id`-declaring leaf). An id that resolves
     to a claim (`clm-`) instead of an experiment, or resolves to nothing, is a
     hard verifier failure (not refresh-fixable). The field is **additive**: it is
     allowed alongside `claims:` OR `no-claim:` and is **not** a primary field — a
     referencing leaf still satisfies Tier 1 coverage via `claims:`/`no-claim:`. An
     owning (`exp-id`) experiment-hosting leaf must **not** also carry
     `experiments:` (an owner does not also reference foreign experiments). Note
     this is the ONLY exclusivity that survives: `claims:` and `exp-id:` are
     **not** mutually exclusive — they are orthogonal node-bodies and may co-exist
     on one leaf.
5. **Single newline EOF.** Every file ends with exactly one `\n`. (Catches editor
   mishaps and trailing-whitespace creep.)
6. **JSON valid.** Every line parses as a JSON object. (Catches partial writes and
   merge corruption.)

---

## Record schemas

All field types are JSON types: `string`, `number` (float), `integer`, `boolean`,
`null`, `array`, `object`. Solidity / confidence values are floats in [0, 1].
Paths are POSIX-style (forward slashes), relative to `<kb-root>/`.

### `claims.jsonl`

Despite the name, `claims.jsonl` holds **five node types** — a type-tagged union
discriminated by the `node_type` field (`claim` | `invariant` | `axiom` |
`experiment` | `support`). Claim nodes are one per `<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`
canonical entry across all `claim-quality.md` files; framework nodes (invariants +
axioms) are parsed from `<kb-root>/CLAUDE.md`; **experiment nodes** are one per
`exp-id: exp-xxxxxx` declaration in a leaf that hosts an experiment (a container
may host several) — regardless of whether that same leaf also originates
`claims:` / `sup-id:` (INVARIANT-S9); **support nodes** are one per
`sup-id: sup-xxxxxx` declaration (a container may likewise host several)
(INVARIANT-S10). The file is **not** split — all node types share one file so a
single referential-integrity pass spans the whole graph.

**Claim record** (`node_type: "claim"`) — `node_type` is the FIRST field.
`derivation_solidity` (min-branch) and `experimental_solidity` (max-branch) are
the two solidity sources; `solidity` is their `max`. 15 fields total.

```typescript
{
  node_type: "claim",            // discriminator — always "claim" here
  id: string,                    // clm-[a-z0-9]{6}; primary key
  title: string,                 // text from the ## heading containing this id
  canonical_path: string,        // e.g. "domain/claim-quality.md"
  canonical_anchor: string,      // GitHub-style anchor for the heading
  confidence: number,            // 0.0 .. 1.0; hand-authored, from Quality section
  derivation_solidity: number,   // 0.0..1.0; DERIVED gating branch: min(local_quality, dep final solidities) — weakest link; null if pending (NaN-propagating)
  experimental_solidity: number, // 0.0..1.0; DERIVED max-branch: max over RUN-experiment strengthens-edge strengths; null if no run experiment strengthens this claim
  solidity: number,              // 0.0 .. 1.0; DERIVED = max of the non-null branch(es); null (*pending*) iff derivation_solidity null AND experimental_solidity null
  build_status: string,          // DERIVED phrase from solidity band, e.g. "ok to build on" (null if solidity null)
  build_band: string,            // DERIVED from solidity: ok-to-build, ok-with-caveats, input-only, do-not-build, refuted
  rationale: string,             // text after "rationale:" — preserved as single line (LF → ' ')
  depends_on_count: integer,     // count of relation:"depends" edges with source == this id
  strengthen_by_count: integer,  // count of items in strengthen-by.jsonl with claim_id == this id
  citation_count: integer        // count of edges in cites.jsonl with claim_id == this id
}
```

Claim field order: `node_type`, `id`, `title`, `canonical_path`,
`canonical_anchor`, `confidence`, `derivation_solidity`, `experimental_solidity`,
`solidity`, `build_status`, `build_band`, `rationale`, `depends_on_count`,
`strengthen_by_count`, `citation_count`.

**Solidity branches (definitive rule).**
- `derivation_solidity` = the gating branch:
  `round2(min(local_quality, *dependency final solidities))` — the **weakest link**
  in the dependency cone, framework deps contributing 1.0 (they never lower the
  min); **pending propagates NaN-style** through this branch (a pending dependency
  → pending `derivation_solidity`). Each dependency contributes its own
  **`solidity`** (the `max`), so building on an experimentally-validated claim
  correctly un-blocks the dependent. **Why `min`, not a product down the chain?**
  Solidity must be *refactor-invariant*: splitting one derivation step into two
  same-quality steps must not lower the result, and a deep clean chain must not
  decay toward 0 as a pure bookkeeping artifact of how finely the derivation was
  subdivided. A product `confidence × dep₁ × dep₂ × …` violates both (it is
  granularity-dependent). The confidence grades are ordinal quality bands, not
  independent probabilities, so multiplying them is not meaningful; the weakest
  link in the cone is the honest summary of "how solid is this, end to end". (The
  change from product → `min` was deliberate; confidence/quality remain
  hand-assessed and unchanged.)
  - `local_quality(C)` =
    `max(confidence(C), max over supporting support-nodes S of sup_solidity(S) × f)`,
    where `f` ∈ (0,1] is the support's on-point fraction for C and a **pending**
    `sup_solidity` is EXCLUDED from the max (no NaN, no poison) — INVARIANT-S10.
    With no supports, `local_quality == confidence`. The support on-point fraction
    `f` is a single edge-weight relevance discount (`sup_solidity × f`) — a lone
    edge, NOT a chain — so it stays **multiplicative** and is not subject to the
    granularity argument above. A support lift is still **dep-gated** (throttled by
    C's own `min(dep finals)`), unlike an experiment's max-branch which bypasses
    deps. CRITICAL: a pending support never drags a beneficiary with
    otherwise-valid quality to pending — pending-poison flows ONLY from a claim's
    own load-bearing `depends-on`, never from an inbound `supports` edge.
  - `sup_solidity(S)` = `round2(min(quality(S), *S's dependency final solidities))`
    — weakest link, same as a claim's derivation; framework deps 1.0; pending if
    `quality` pending OR any dep pending; free-standing (no deps) → `quality`.
    Computed by the SAME shared function as claim solidity
    (`compute_solidity_full`), so refresh and verify never dual-compute it.
- `experimental_solidity` = `max` of the `strength` on every
  `relation:"strengthens"` edge into this claim whose source experiment has
  `status:"run"`. Unrun experiments contribute nothing (excluded from the max —
  **no NaN, no 0.0 floor**). `null` if no run experiment strengthens this claim.
- `solidity` = `max(derivation_solidity, experimental_solidity)` over the non-null
  branches; **`*pending*` (null) iff BOTH are null** — i.e. derivation pending AND
  no run experiment. (`*pending*` = unassessed ≠ `0.0` = refuted; an unrun
  experiment can never float a pending claim down to a refuted 0.0.)
- **Non-transitive:** a `strengthens` edge lifts only its directly-targeted claim.
  An experiment that also bears on an upstream input authors a *separate*
  `strengthens` edge to that input with its own `strength`.

**Experiment record** (`node_type: "experiment"`) — a *physical* experiment node.
Experiments are terminal strength-sources: they have **no `relation:"depends"`
edges** and never gate; they only emit `relation:"strengthens"` edges to the
claims their result bears on. 6 fields.

```typescript
{
  node_type: "experiment",       // discriminator
  id: string,                    // exp-[a-z0-9]{6}; primary key
  title: string,                 // experiment / project leaf title
  canonical_path: string,        // POSIX path of the experiment leaf, relative to <kb-root>/
  canonical_anchor: string,      // GitHub-style anchor for the heading carrying the exp-id
  status: "run" | "pending"      // "run" = result exists (its strengthens edges count); "pending" = unrun (its edges contribute nothing)
}
```

Experiment field order: `node_type`, `id`, `title`, `canonical_path`,
`canonical_anchor`, `status`. A **physical** experiment **the authors design,
originate, and control** only — simulations are NOT experiments (a simulation
feeds derivation confidence, not experimental solidity), and a re-analysis of
outside/public data is a `sup-` support node (INVARIANT-S10) or a `clm-` citation,
never an `exp-` (see INVARIANT-S9). A container may host SEVERAL `exp-id:` (each
`exp-id:` key opens its own `status:`/`strengthens:` block; a single `exp-id:` is
the one-element case, so existing single-experiment leaves are unchanged) and may
also originate its own `claims:` and/or `sup-id:` — orthogonal node-bodies in one
container, not mutually exclusive. When co-hosted, the leaf emits a
`node_type: claim` record AND one `node_type: experiment` record per `exp-id` (all
sharing the container's canonical home), and an experiment's `strengthens` edge may
target that same leaf's own claim (a node→node edge between two distinct
co-located nodes — not a self-loop).

**Support record** (`node_type: "support"`) — a non-physical analytical SUPPORT
node (INVARIANT-S10). A support is claim-like inside (carries a local-rigor
`quality` and may consume its own `depends-on` claims), experiment-like in fan-out
(one support may help many claims via `relation:"supports"` edges), and contributes
to the DERIVATION branch of each beneficiary (never the experimental/max branch).
7 fields.

```typescript
{
  node_type: "support",          // discriminator
  id: string,                    // sup-[a-z0-9]{6}; primary key
  title: string,                 // support / analysis leaf title (its `##`/`#` heading)
  canonical_path: string,        // POSIX path of the support-hosting leaf, relative to <kb-root>/
  canonical_anchor: string,      // GitHub-style anchor for the heading
  quality: number | null,        // 0.0..1.0; hand-authored local rigor (claim-`confidence` analog); null if *pending*
  solidity: number | null        // 0.0..1.0; DERIVED sup_solidity = round2(min(quality, dep final solidities)) — weakest link; null if pending
}
```

Support field order: `node_type`, `id`, `title`, `canonical_path`,
`canonical_anchor`, `quality`, `solidity`.

A support node's `quality` / `depends-on` / `solidity` write-back live in a
**claim-quality-style entry keyed by the sup-id** (a `<!-- id: sup-xxxxxx -->`
marker + a `### Quality` block with `quality:` / `depends-on:` / `solidity:` /
`rationale:`, parallel to a claim entry — `quality:` in place of `confidence:`).
The beneficiary fan-out is authored in the **hosting leaf's** `supports:`
frontmatter block (parallel to an experiment's `strengthens:`), one
`clm-<id>: <fraction>` pair per beneficiary. A container may host SEVERAL
`sup-id:` — each `sup-id:` key opens its own `supports:` block (the pairs that
follow belong to that block until the next `sup-id:`); a single `sup-id:` is the
one-element case. Each `sup-id` materializes its own support record (sharing the
container's canonical home) and its own `supports` edges. A leaf may co-host
`sup-id:` with `claims:` / `exp-id:` / `no-claim:` — orthogonal node-bodies.
`sup_solidity` is dep-gated and pending-propagating exactly like a claim's
derivation; a free-standing support (no deps) has `sup_solidity == quality`.

**Framework record** (`node_type: "invariant"` or `"axiom"`) — exactly 5 fields.
Framework nodes carry no scoring fields: they are **solidity-1.0 by definition**
(framework bedrock). This is a documented rule, not a stored field.

```typescript
{
  node_type: "invariant" | "axiom",
  id: string,                    // "INVARIANT-XX" verbatim, or "axiom-N" lowercase (N in 1..4)
  title: string,                 // invariant heading title, or axiom bold-text title
  canonical_path: "CLAUDE.md",   // always — framework nodes live in <kb-root>/CLAUDE.md
  canonical_anchor: string       // GitHub-style slug (see provenance below)
}
```

Framework field order: `node_type`, `id`, `title`, `canonical_path`,
`canonical_anchor`.

**Framework-node provenance** (from `<kb-root>/CLAUDE.md`):

- **Invariants** — parsed from `### INVARIANT-XX: <title>` headings (regex
  `^### (INVARIANT-[A-Z]+[0-9]+):\s*(.+)$`). `id` is the label verbatim;
  `canonical_anchor` is the slug of the node's own heading. A subsumed/tombstone
  invariant heading (one whose rule was folded into another but whose heading is
  retained) is still parsed, so cross-references to it continue to resolve. A KB
  that declares no invariant headings has zero framework invariant nodes.
- **Axioms** (optional, up to 4) — parsed from `- Axiom N: **<title>** — ...`
  bullets (regex `^- Axiom ([1-4]): \*\*(.+?)\*\*`, so N ∈ 1..4) located in
  whichever invariant section serves as the axiom-numbering authority. `id` is
  `axiom-N` lowercase; `title` is the bold text; every axiom anchors to that
  section's heading slug. A KB that elevates none of its foundational assumptions
  to axioms has zero axiom nodes.

**Sort key.** Records are sorted by `(node_type, id)` — explicit grouping by ASCII
order of the discriminator: axioms, then claims, then experiments, then invariants,
then **support** (alphabetical: axiom < claim < experiment < invariant < support).

**`build_band` derivation** (mechanical, from solidity):

| Solidity range | `build_band` value |
|---|---|
| 0.85 ≤ s ≤ 1.00 | `ok-to-build` |
| 0.65 ≤ s < 0.85 | `ok-with-caveats` |
| 0.45 ≤ s < 0.65 | `input-only` |
| 0.20 ≤ s < 0.45 | `do-not-build` |
| 0.00 ≤ s < 0.20 | `refuted` |

This mirrors the build-status legend in the root `claim-quality.md` and provides a
machine-stable enum for filtering even if the human-readable `build_status`
phrasing drifts. The ladder is single-sourced in `kb_schema.BUILD_BAND_LADDER`.

**Solidity is derived, not parsed.** `solidity`, `build_status`, and `build_band`
are NOT read from the claim-quality.md `solidity` line — they are computed by
`kb_index_lib.compute_solidity` from the hand-authored `confidence` values and the
depends-on DAG (`solidity = round-half-up-2dp(min(confidence, *dependency
solidities))` — the weakest link; framework-target dependencies contribute 1.0 and
never lower the min). The claim-quality.md `solidity` line is itself a write-back
of the same computation (the refresh target). The freshness verifier hard-fails if the
on-disk claim-quality.md solidity content or these JSONL fields disagree with the
recomputed values.

**HARD RULE — `*pending*` propagates transitively (NaN semantics).** A claim's
solidity is `*pending*` (uncomputable) if its `confidence` is `*pending*` (not yet
quality-assessed) **OR** any of its dependencies' solidity is `*pending*` —
**regardless of the claim's own local `confidence`**. A claim with
`confidence: 1.0` that depends on one pending claim still has solidity `*pending*`.
Pending-ness propagates through the depends-on DAG exactly like NaN through
arithmetic. Framework-node dependencies (invariant / axiom targets) are **never**
pending — they are solidity-1.0 bedrock by definition, so a claim depending only on
framework nodes is not pending (its solidity equals its confidence). A claim with a
pending solidity carries `null` for `solidity`, `build_status`, and `build_band` in
`claims.jsonl`, the bare `- solidity: *pending*` line in claim-quality.md, and
`(solidity *pending*)` wherever it is a depends-on target. Every consumer treats
"absent from `compute_solidity`'s result" identically to "pending".

**Rationale-text normalization:** preserve text verbatim except for collapsing
internal line breaks to single spaces (so rationale is one-line JSON-safe). Inline
markdown (backticks, asterisks) is preserved.

### `depends-on.jsonl`

One record per directed claim-graph edge. The file holds **three edge classes**
discriminated by `relation`:

- **`depends`** (gating, min-branch): `source` is a **claim** OR a **support** id
  (a support's own deps are `depends` edges sourced at the sup-id); `target` is a
  claim / invariant / axiom id. `strength` and `fraction` are null.
- **`strengthens`** (max-branch): `source` is an **experiment** id; `target` is a
  **claim** id; carries a `strength`. `fraction` null. Authored from the experiment
  leaf's `strengthens:` block.
- **`supports`** (DERIVATION-branch lift, INVARIANT-S10): `source` is a **support**
  id; `target` is a **claim** id; `target_kind` is `"claim"`; carries an on-point
  `fraction` ∈ (0,1] **OR** the literal string `"*pending*"` (an
  intended-but-unassessed edge); `strength` null. The `"*pending*"` fraction is
  DISTINCT on disk from a `depends` edge's `null` fraction: null means "no fraction
  applies to this edge class", `"*pending*"` means "a fraction applies but is
  unassessed". A pending fraction contributes nothing to the beneficiary's
  `local_quality` (excluded from the max, like a pending `sup_solidity`) and never
  poisons it. Authored from the support leaf's `supports:` block and emitted by
  `refresh`. The derivation-branch analog of a `strengthens` edge.

```typescript
{
  source: string,                          // claim/support id (depends) | experiment id (strengthens) | support id (supports)
  target: string,                          // claim/invariant/axiom (depends); claim (strengthens / supports)
  relation: "depends" | "strengthens" | "supports",  // edge class
  target_kind: "claim" | "invariant" | "axiom",  // node type of the target
  target_solidity_recorded: number | null, // depends: dep solidity as written; null for framework / strengthens / supports
  strength: number | null,                 // strengthens: conferred experimental-solidity in [0,1]; null otherwise
  context: string | null,                  // optional context note
  fraction: number | "*pending*" | null    // supports: on-point fraction f ∈ (0,1] or "*pending*" (unassessed); null otherwise
}
```

Field order: `source`, `target`, `relation`, `target_kind`,
`target_solidity_recorded`, `strength`, `context`, `fraction`. Every record carries
all eight keys (schema closure); only the relevant ones are non-null per edge
class.

`relation` is recoverable from `source`-node type (claim ⇒ depends, experiment ⇒
strengthens), but is stored explicitly so a human reviewer sees each edge's *role*
at a glance and `compute_solidity` need not cross-reference node types. A
`strengthens` edge's `strength` is the per-(experiment, claim) conferred
experimental-solidity — typically `1.0` for the experiment's designed target on an
unequivocal result, lower for orthogonally-implicated claims; it counts only when
the source experiment has `status: "run"`.

**Bullet-head extraction.** A depends-on bullet's dependency target(s) live in its
*head*, not its title/context. The head is the bullet text after the leading `- `,
truncated at the EARLIER of: the first ` — ` (em-dash title separator) or the first
` (` (paren). The head is scanned for ALL recognized target tokens, emitting **one
edge per token**:

- `\bclm-[a-z0-9]{6}\b` → `target_kind: "claim"`; `target_solidity_recorded` parsed
  from a `(solidity <num>)` group; `context` from a trailing `[...]` group (an
  `[= ...]` arithmetic annotation is skipped).
- `\bINVARIANT-[A-Z]+[0-9]+\b` → `target_kind: "invariant"`, `target` the label
  verbatim, `target_solidity_recorded: null`; `context` from the bullet's first
  `(...)` paren content.
- `\bAxiom [1-4]\b` → `target_kind: "axiom"`, `target` normalized to `axiom-N`
  lowercase, `target_solidity_recorded: null`; `context` from the first `(...)`
  paren content.

A normal claim bullet `- clm-aaaaaa — Title (solidity 0.4)` has head `clm-aaaaaa` →
one claim edge. A framework bullet `- INVARIANT-S2 / Axiom 4 (saturation kernel —
...)` has head `INVARIANT-S2 / Axiom 4` → two edges (invariant + axiom), both
carrying the paren content as context.

**Non-edges:** Quality sections may contain a placeholder line like
`- *(none entry-local — ...)*`. These are recognized by the leading asterisk +
italic marker and produce zero edges. A bullet whose head contains no recognized
token also produces zero edges — e.g. `- none entry-local — Axiom 4 is framework
input...` has head `none entry-local`; the `Axiom 4` after the em-dash is
explanatory text, not a target, and is not scanned.

**Sort key.** `(source, target, context)` — a null context sorts as the empty
string. The context component keeps two edges from the same source to the same
target (e.g. an `INVARIANT-S2` dependency declared in two separate bullets with
different context notes) deterministically ordered.

### `strengthen-by.jsonl`

One record per `strengthen-by` bullet in a claim's Quality section.

```typescript
{
  claim_id: string,        // the claim whose Quality section contains this strengthen-by item
  item_idx: integer,       // 0-indexed position within the strengthen-by list (preserves order)
  text: string,            // bullet text, single-line normalized
  mentioned_ids: string[]  // claim ids mentioned in `text` (lowercase, deduplicated, sorted)
}
```

Field order: `claim_id`, `item_idx`, `text`, `mentioned_ids`.

**Multi-line bullets** are collapsed to single lines (LF → ' '), preserving inline
markdown.

**`mentioned_ids` extraction:** match the `\bclm-[a-z0-9]{6}\b` pattern in `text`.
The `clm-` prefix makes the pattern exact — it cannot match incidental prose words.
A `clm-`-shaped token that doesn't match any record in `claims.jsonl` is still
emitted, and signals a typo or stale reference (the verifier flags orphan-style
consistency issues globally).

### `supported-by.jsonl`

One record per (claim, supporting support-node) edge — the reverse view of the
`supports` edges in `depends-on.jsonl` (INVARIANT-S10). It answers "which support
nodes lift claim X, and by how much?". It is **untraversed bookkeeping** —
solidity flows forward through the `supports` edges; this file is a convenience
reverse index analogous to `strengthen-by`, never consulted in the solidity
computation.

```typescript
{
  claim_id: string,          // the beneficiary claim
  sup_id: string,            // the supporting support node (sup-[a-z0-9]{6})
  fraction: number | "*pending*", // the on-point fraction f ∈ (0,1] of this support for this claim, or "*pending*" if unassessed
  sup_solidity: number | null // the support's computed sup_solidity (same shared computation); null if pending
}
```

Field order: `claim_id`, `sup_id`, `fraction`, `sup_solidity`. Sort key
`(claim_id, sup_id)`. Referential integrity: every `claim_id` resolves to a
`claim` node and every `sup_id` to a `support` node in `claims.jsonl`.

**Leaf-references footer (derived).** Each `clm-` / `exp-` / `sup-` entry in a
`claim-quality.md` register carries a `> **Leaf references:**` blockquote footer —
the reverse-citation map of which leaves host the entry's id. It is a **derived
field** regenerated by the refresh target (`kb_index_lib.build_leaf_references` →
`render_leaf_references`) and drift-gated by the verify target, exactly like
`subtree-claims` and the derived `solidity` line; **do not hand-edit it.** The map
is fully derivable from leaf frontmatter: a `clm-` lists every leaf whose `claims:`
declares it (the same leaf→claim edges in `cites.jsonl`); an `exp-` lists its
canonical home (the `exp-id:`-hosting leaf) plus any leaf referencing it via
`experiments:`; a `sup-` lists its canonical home (the `sup-id:`-hosting leaf).
Each footer is a single blockquote line of stable-sorted relative Markdown links
(`[<name>](./<rel>)`, where `<rel>` is the leaf path relative to the register's
directory and `<name>` is the leaf filename stem — real link text, no backticks, so
the footer links are checked by `verify_md_links` and a dead path *gates* instead
of rotting silently), comma-joined, with **all free-text editorial annotations
dropped** (the rot the derived footer eliminates). The footer is
found-and-replaced as one stable region between the entry's `<!-- id: … -->` marker
and its `### Quality` heading (inserted there if absent). A hand-edited or stale
footer is a `refresh-fixable` verifier failure. The bidirectional-coverage check
guarantees every canonical entry is cited by ≥ 1 leaf, so an empty footer is
abnormal; an id with no citing leaf regenerates to an explicit `*(none …)*` marker
rather than a bare prefix.

### `cites.jsonl`

One record per (claim, leaf) citation edge. A leaf's frontmatter
`claims: [a, b, c]` produces three edges.

```typescript
{
  claim_id: string,         // clm-[a-z0-9]{6} id
  leaf_path: string,        // POSIX path relative to <kb-root>/
  leaf_kind: string,        // "leaf" or "leaf-as-index"
  tier2_marked: boolean     // true iff leaf body has a proximal <!-- claim-quality: <id> ... --> marker for this id
}
```

Field order: `claim_id`, `leaf_path`, `leaf_kind`, `tier2_marked`.

**`tier2_marked` semantics:** matches the existing Tier 2 verifier rule
(INVARIANT-S8). For single-claim leaves, Tier 2 is not required by the verifier; in
those cases `tier2_marked` is `false` unless the leaf chose to also include a
marker. The flag captures observed state, not requiredness; downstream consumers
can filter by it.

### `subtree-aggregates.jsonl`

One record per index file (`kind: index`) plus the single entry-point node.

```typescript
{
  node_path: string,            // POSIX path relative to <kb-root>/
  node_kind: string,            // "index" or "entry-point"
  subtree_claims: string[],     // sorted unique list of all claim ids OWNED under this node's subtree
  subtree_experiments: string[] // sorted unique list of all exp-ids OWNED under this node's subtree
}
```

Field order: `node_path`, `node_kind`, `subtree_claims`, `subtree_experiments`.

This file persists what refresh already computes transiently for the
frontmatter `subtree-claims:` and `subtree-experiments:` fields. Having it
materialized as JSONL means cross-volume aggregation queries don't require
re-walking the tree.

**`subtree_experiments` (owned-only).** The union of exp-ids OWNED (declared via
`exp-id:`) by experiment leaves under this node's directory (`kind: index`) or the
whole KB (`kind: entry-point`). It is the experiment analog of `subtree_claims`,
and OWNED-ONLY in the same sense: just as a leaf's foreign depends-on references
never enter `subtree_claims` (only its owned `claims:` support rolls up), a leaf's
`experiments:` REFERENCES never propagate into `subtree_experiments` — only an
experiment leaf's own `exp-id:` declaration does. Sorted with the same ordering
convention as `subtree_claims`. Both this JSONL key and the frontmatter
`subtree-experiments:` field are derived from the single shared
`kb_index_lib.compute_subtree_aggregates`, so the materialized aggregate, the
refresh write-back, and the verify consistency check cannot drift; declared
`subtree-experiments` ≠ the computed owned union is a refresh-fixable verifier
failure.

## Query semantics (`kb_cmd/index.py`)

The runtime module loads these JSONL files once per process and exposes the
canonical question shapes as Python functions. Stdlib only (no pip deps).

```python
# kb_cmd/index.py exposes the query surface and re-exports `load` via
# kb_cmd/__init__.py. It is a normal package, so `from kb_tools.kb_cmd import load`
# (or `from kb_cmd.index import load`) works directly. The CLI (below) is the
# usual entry point.

idx = load()                          # default index dir: <kb-root>/.index/ (via kb_util)
idx = load(path="...")                # explicit path override

# Forward dependency edges (work for any node id, including framework ids)
idx.depends_on("clm-aaaaaa")              # → list[str] of target node ids
idx.dependents_of("clm-bbbbbb")           # → list[str] of source claim ids (inverse)
idx.dependents_of("INVARIANT-S2")         # → claims that break if this invariant changes

# Open work
idx.strengthen_by("clm-cccccc")           # → list[StrengthenByItem]
idx.gated_on("clm-bbbbbb")                # → list[str] of claim_ids whose strengthen-by mentions "clm-bbbbbb"

# Citation / leaf membership
idx.cited_by("clm-aaaaaa")                # → list[CitationEdge] (leaves citing this claim)
idx.claims_in_leaf("domain/section/leaf.md")  # → claim ids cited by that leaf

# Subtree aggregation
idx.subtree_claims("domain")          # → list[str] of all claim ids under domain/
idx.subtree_claims("")                # → list[str] (whole tree; same as entry-point's aggregate)

# Filters
idx.solidity_below(0.7)               # → list[Claim] with solidity < threshold
idx.in_band("do-not-build")           # → list[Claim] in given build_band

# Lookup
idx.claim("clm-cccccc")                   # → Claim | None (None for framework ids)
idx.node("INVARIANT-S2")                  # → Claim | FrameworkNode | None (any node type)
```

`claim()` resolves claim ids only — it returns `None` for an invariant or axiom id.
`node()` resolves any node type. The filter queries `solidity_below`, `in_band`,
and `all_claims` operate on claim nodes only (framework nodes have no scoring
fields); `framework_nodes` and `all_nodes` expose the framework subset and the full
node set respectively.

Record types (`Claim`, `FrameworkNode`, `CitationEdge`, `StrengthenByItem`, etc.)
are simple dataclasses constructed from the JSONL records on load. `claims.jsonl`
is loaded as a type-tagged union: each record is dispatched on its `node_type` to a
`Claim` or a `FrameworkNode`. The module favors plain Python types over heavy
abstractions.

**Performance budget:** at KB scales in the low hundreds of leaves and a
low-hundreds node set, full load + every-query is well under 10 ms cold; subsequent
queries against the loaded in-memory structures are microseconds. Full rebuild
stays well under a second at these scales. No caching/lazy-loading needed until
rebuild time crosses a few seconds.

---

## CLI surface

A thin CLI wrapper exposes the most common queries for shell use, backed by the
same `kb_cmd/index.py` module, invoked as a module:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=<repo> python3 -m kb_tools.kb_cmd <cmd>

deps <claim_id>               # ids X depends on
deps -i <claim_id>            # inverse: ids that depend on X
gated-on <claim_id>           # claims whose strengthen-by mentions X
cited-by <claim_id>           # leaves citing X
solidity-below <threshold>    # claims with solidity < N
weak-points                   # shaky AND load-bearing claims (rework targets)
subtree <path>                # ids in subtree
show <claim_id>               # full record for one node (claim, invariant, axiom)
stats                         # counts summary
```

JSON output via `--json` flag for piping to `jq`. The project's stats target is
the packaged shortcut for the dashboard.

## Build pipeline

```
canonical state  ──▶  refresh_kb_metadata.py  ──▶  derived state
─────────────────                            ──────────────────
frontmatter on              parse leaves                 frontmatter
indexes /                   parse claim-quality          subtree-claims
entry-point                 build index records          REWRITTEN
                            compute solidity             .index/*.jsonl
claim-quality.md            (shared kb_index_lib)        WRITTEN
files                                                    (sorted, deterministic)
```

`refresh_kb_metadata.py` is idempotent: same canonical state → same outputs,
byte-identical.

`verify_kb_metadata.py`:
- Runs the structural checks (Tier 1 coverage — a leaf declares its content via at
  least one of `{claims, no-claim, exp-id}`; Tier 2, ID uniqueness, orphans,
  frontmatter presence, subtree consistency, bidirectional coverage,
  claim/no-claim exclusivity — `claims` and `no-claim` stay mutually exclusive with
  each other, but `exp-id` is orthogonal to both).
- runs the index build in-memory; diffs against `.index/*.jsonl` on disk; any
  difference is a `refresh-fixable` failure with the project's refresh target as
  the remediation hint.
- validates each JSONL file is well-formed JSON line-by-line; reports parse
  failures as hard failures.
- validates referential integrity (every id referenced in any non-claims file
  appears in `claims.jsonl`).
- validates leaf `experiments:` references resolve to experiment nodes (orphan /
  claim-id-mismatch is a hard failure, not refresh-fixable) and that declared
  `subtree-experiments` equals the computed owned union (refresh-fixable).
- checks the claim depends-on graph is acyclic (a cycle makes solidity undefined —
  hard failure, not refresh-fixable).
- checks solidity freshness — every claim-quality.md `solidity` line, its
  build-status phrase, the depends-on `(solidity X)` annotations, and the
  `claims.jsonl` solidity fields must equal `compute_solidity`'s output
  (`refresh-fixable`).

`verify_md_links.py` gates every `.md` file in the repo for dead links (a separate,
repo-wide pass run alongside metadata verification by the verify target).

---

## Design decisions (settled)

- **Where in the tree?** `.index/` under `<kb-root>/`. Grep-discoverable, tracked in
  git.
- **One file or several?** Six files split by record/edge type (claims, depends-on,
  strengthen-by, supported-by, cites, subtree-aggregates).
- **Deterministic ordering?** Per-file sort key documented above.
- **Incremental or full-rebuild?** Always full-rebuild. Revisit if rebuild time
  crosses a few seconds.
- **Freshness check location?** The verifier (the verify target) is the checkpoint. A
  pre-commit hook can be added separately when a project installs one.

**Solidity as `min` (weakest link), not a product.** Recorded here because it is the
non-obvious core of the model: `compute_solidity` computes
`solidity = round-half-up-2dp(min(confidence, *dep_solidity))` over the depends-on
DAG, `refresh_kb_metadata.py` writes it back to claim-quality.md and the JSONL, and
`verify_kb_metadata.py` carries a standing freshness check plus a depends-on
acyclicity check. Rationale: refactor-invariance (see the solidity-branches rule
above).

### Deliberately out of scope

- **Embeddings / full-text search** — a separate concern; layer on top if needed.
- **Synonym / alias resolution** — sameness of two surface forms is encoded by id
  only; no aliasing.
- **History queries** — `git log .index/claims.jsonl` provides this for free.
- **Cross-claim consistency edges** (e.g. a structured `excludes` edge for
  mutually-exclusive claims) — encoded informally in prose today; a candidate
  future edge class.

---

## Conformance checklist

A build conforms to this spec when:

- `claims.jsonl` line count == code-fence-scrubbed count of `<!-- id: clm-xxxxxx -->`
  across all `claim-quality.md` files (i.e. excluding example placeholders inside
  fenced code blocks; a naive `grep -c` over-counts by the number of fenced
  examples). Analogously for `exp-`/`sup-` entries when the KB exercises them.
- `cites.jsonl` line count == sum of `len(claims)` across all leaves with `claims:`
  frontmatter.
- `subtree-aggregates.jsonl` line count == number of `kind: index` files + 1
  (entry-point).
- Every id referenced in any non-claims `.jsonl` file appears in `claims.jsonl`.
- The verify target exits 0 after refresh on the current canonical state.
