"""Regenerate derived KB metadata fields from leaf claims.

Side-effecting: writes to index.md / entry-point.md frontmatter blocks and to
the derived ``solidity`` fields of every ``claim-quality.md`` register.
Idempotent. Run via the project's refresh target (or directly as
``python3 -m kb_tools.refresh_kb_metadata``).

Currently regenerates:
    * ``subtree-claims`` on every ``kind: index`` file
    * ``subtree-claims`` on the ``kind: entry-point`` file
    * the ``- solidity:`` line of every claim entry in every ``claim-quality.md``
      register — value, build-status phrase, and arithmetic trace are all
      derived from the hand-authored ``confidence`` values via
      ``kb_index_lib.compute_solidity``
    * the ``(solidity X)`` annotation in every claim-target depends-on bullet,
      synced to the depended-on claim's computed solidity

Future: bootstrap directive blockquote text (currently hand-maintained).

This script does NOT verify; it ONLY refreshes. Run the project's verify
target afterward to confirm the result is internally consistent.
